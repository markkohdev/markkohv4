            <b>A summary of me in 3 sentences:</b> I am a student at Drexel University studying Computer Science with a strong focus (and a minor) in Software Engineering.  My passion for development allows me to think outside of the box in order to come up with the best solution to a problem - whether it's taking a new approach to responsive design or making robots dance to music like humans do by using Markov-Chain algorithms.  All in all, I just love programming, development, and just about everything computer-related (and music, of course!).

          <p>
            I now attend Drexel University in Philadelphia, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Software Engineering as well as concentrations in Data Structures and Algorithms, Human-Computer Interaction, and (you guessed it) Software Engineering.  Since my freshman year here at Drexel, I've been involved in research at the <a href="http://music.ece.drexel.edu" target="_blank">Music, Entertainment, Technology Laboratory (the MET-lab for short)</a>, a place where I can let my passion for music intersect with my love for development.  Feel free to read more about my work at the MET-lab in my <a ui-sref="default.portfolio">portfolio</a>!  Outside of my lab, I am constantly juggling side projects which I can't seem to stop thinking about.  When it comes down to it, I just really love doing too many things, and there need to be more hours in the day so I can actually spend time on all of them!
