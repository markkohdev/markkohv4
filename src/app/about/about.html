            <b>A summary of me in 3 sentences:</b> I am a student at Drexel University studying Computer Science with a strong focus (and a minor) in Software Engineering.  My passion for development allows me to think outside of the box in order to come up with the best solution to a problem - whether it's taking a new approach to responsive design or making robots dance to music like humans do by using Markov-Chain algorithms.  All in all, I just love programming, development, and just about everything computer-related (and music, of course!).

          <h3 class="md-title">Where am I now?</h3>
          <p>
            I now attend Drexel University in Philadelphia, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Software Engineering as well as concentrations in Data Structures and Algorithms, Human-Computer Interaction, and (you guessed it) Software Engineering.  Since my freshman year here at Drexel, I've been involved in research at the <a href="http://music.ece.drexel.edu" target="_blank">Music, Entertainment, Technology Laboratory (the MET-lab for short)</a>, a place where I can let my passion for music intersect with my love for development.  Feel free to read more about my work at the MET-lab in my <a ui-sref="default.portfolio">portfolio</a>!  Outside of my lab, I am constantly juggling side projects which I can't seem to stop thinking about.  When it comes down to it, I just really love doing too many things, and there need to be more hours in the day so I can actually spend time on all of them!

          <h3 class="md-title">Some other things I do</h3>
          <p>
            I am a member of the <a href="http://draepi.org/" target="_blank">Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Rho</a> chapter here on Drexel's campus, previously holding positions on the Executive and Minor boards.  I like to play around with photography in my free time, and I've built up quite a collection of photos.  At some point soon I'll move them over to this site, but for now feel free to check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markkoh" target="_blank">Flickr</a> account!  In general, I'm a pretty outdoorsy person when I'm not doing work - I love skiing, rock climbing, wakeboarding, swimming, and mountain biking.

          <h3 class="md-title">Background</h3>
          <p>
            I graduated from Brookfield High School (Brookfield, CT) in 2011.  During my time there I was involved in many extra-curriculars including the Connecticut Innovation Academy (CTIA), Yearbook, Boy Scouts (Troop 8), the Wrestling Team, Drama Club, KEY Club, FIRST Robotics, and Elephunk Cancer Charity.  By my senior year, I had either held or was holding a leadership position in just about all of these clubs - Editor for the Yearbook, Team Leader for CTIA, Senior Patrol Leader for the Boy Scouts, Technical Director for the Drama Club, Webmaster for the KEY Club, among other smaller positions.  All of these clubs led me to be the person I am today.  Although it's hard to be quite as involved in college, I still value all of the experience I gained from these groups in high school, and I try to continue them here at Drexel.
