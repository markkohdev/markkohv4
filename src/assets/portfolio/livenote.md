### About the Project
During the summer after my Freshman year, I took part in the STAR (Students Tackling Advanced Research) program, where I did work in the MET-Lab (Music, Entertainment, and Technology Laboratory) with LiveNote.

LiveNote is a system that helps users by guiding them through the performance using a handheld application in real-time. Using audio features, we attempt to align the live performance audio with that of a previously annotated reference recording. The aligned position is transmitted to users handheld devices and pre-annotated information about the piece is displayed synchronously with the performance.

My contribution to the project was the creation of a content management system, called the LiveNote authoring system, which allowed experts from the Orchestra to easily write their own annotations for each piece.  Alongside this, the system also allowed the Orchestra to manually advance annotations in the event that the automatic detection of concert location were to fail.

This project was my introduction to using actual databases, and how to efficiently call databases in combination with storing data in session.  After a year of dedication to the project, it is now effectively in the hands of the Philadelphia Orchestra.\n\nYou can find more information on [the official project page](http://music.ece.drexel.edu/research/LiveNote) and on [the Phildelphia Orchestra website](https://www.philorch.org/introducing-livenote%E2%84%A2#/)
