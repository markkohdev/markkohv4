# Markkoh.net v4 dawg!
Oh hey it's Mark's website!
Previously PHP based, I've made the move over to AngularJS.
Since my website doesn't really need a backend there's no point in going through the pain of dealing with PHP, hence the migration.

Directives are king!

### ...why is this a public repo?
Because as a student I only get 5 private ones and I ain't got any private info on here.

### v4?
Yep.  I've owned Markkoh.net since I was just a wee lad (sophomore year of hike school).
Since then, I've completely overhauled the site 3 times.
The evolution:

##### v1 - [markkoh.net/v1](http://markkoh.net/v1)
![v1](http://markkoh.net/v1/preview.jpg)

##### v2 - [markkoh.net/v2](http://markkoh.net/v2)
![v2](http://markkoh.net/v2/preview.jpg)

##### v3 - [markkoh.net/v3](http://markkoh.net/v3)
![v3](http://markkoh.net/v3/preview.jpg)



#### How the heck do I run this thing?
Install node, bower, and gulp
```
$ brew install node
$ npm install -g bower gulp
```

- Install Node and NPM
- From the root dir, run
```
$ npm install
