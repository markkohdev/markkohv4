# Markkoh.net v4 dawg!
Oh hey it's Mark's website!
Previously PHP based, I've made the move over to AngularJS, my new go-to for
front-end development.  Since my website doesn't really need a backend there's
no point in going through the pain of dealing with PHP, hence the migration.

Directives are king!

### ...why is this a public repo?
Because as a student I only get 5 private ones and I ain't got any private info on here.

### v4?
Yep.  I've owned Markkoh.net since I was just a wee lad (sophomore year of hike school).
Since then, I've completely overhauled the site 3 times.

At some point (hopefully soon) I'll post the evolution in this here readme.


#### How the heck do I run this thing?
- Install Node and NPM
- From the root dir, run
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
- Then run
```
$ gulp serve
```
and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
